CPSC 60000 Final Project

This is my final project, which is a Java implementation of Connect4. The project can be found in the **GDSConnect4** directory. Please note, the directory Connect4Txt contains an initial version of the project which uses a text-based UI. This project was mostly used as prototype for the AIPlayer and is here for historical purposes only.

The **GDSConnect4** project uses a JavaFX UI. To build and run the project, I have used JavaSE-12, with JavaFX-11 and have followed the instructions to create a JavaFX non-modular project using the IDE tools from https://openjfx.io/openjfx-docs/. I have verified that this works in both Intellij and Eclipse.

Furthermore, the project uses JUnit 5 for unit testing. Also, the usual .project and .classpath entries have been commented out in the .gitignore and are added here, which is hopefully a convenience for the professor.

The main method for the **GDSConnect4** project can be found in the class org.gds.GameView

A formal report which describes the **GDSConnect4** project and the Design Patterns implemented is available, and will be provided separately.
